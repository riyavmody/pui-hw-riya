                    <div>
                        <p>At the age of 15, a boy named Jet changed my life. He showed me my purpose: to advocate for those without a voice. Jet has Down Syndrome and he struggled to verbalize his love for others, but I never felt we needed words to communicate.</p>
                        <p>In the countless hours we spent together, Jet had never said my name; I wasn't sure he even knew who I was. But every game of catch we played, every book we read together, was a connection being built.</p>
                        <p>One day, he broke down his barriers and said, "Awiyah?" meaning Riya. Since that day, Jet remembers the name of every person he interacts with.</p>

                        <p> Being part of these beautiful “Angel moments” illuminated a path towards applied behavioral analysis therapy, or so I thought. It wasn’t until halfway through my undergraduate studies, that I discovered the world of technology. I learned about the power of visual storytelling through analytics and how data can reveal insights that would normally elude the naked eye. I began building my skills in coding, statistics, and even advanced modeling.</p>

                    <h2>My Love for Research</h2>
                    <p> As an Undergraduate Research Assistant in Dr. LouAnne Boyd’s lab, I explored data science in the wild, investigating how to alter visual perception in individuals with Autism. I stepped outside my comfort zone, learning to architect databases, perform image processing in Python, and model data in R. This effort culminated in a peer-reviewed journal article. By senior year, I had mastered these skills, so Dr. Boyd and I launched an empirical research study to advance our published work. Over a year, we designed the study, ran participants, and analyzed findings, while ensuring ethical practices and accommodating each participant's unique accessibility needs. </p>

                    <h2>The Numbers</h2>
                    <p> In my industry work, I centered technology design around users. As a Data Analyst on an agile team, I used informal UX research methods—interviews, task analysis, and prototype testing—to enhance dashboard analytics. By redesigning the information architecture and coding the back end, I streamlined an over-engineered dashboard into an intuitive data story, boosting adoption by 50%. Conversations and shadowing with sales managers, salespeople, and business leaders informed a redesign that aligned the tool with their priorities while delivering actionable insights. </p>
