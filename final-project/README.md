# **FP2 \- Evaluation of the Final project**

## Project Description

The basic idea is to create a website that will support and showcase, Angels on Stage, a performing arts program designed for children with disabilities. I would like this website to be more visually eye-catching than it is currently so that it can drive more traffic and donations. Additionally, it should fit the vision and mission of the program so that the staff who manage the website could make any necessary adjustments if they decided to adopt the design.

## High-Fi Prototypes

# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1 - Personal Portfolio*

![Portfolio home page](images/portfolio-home-page.png)
![Portfolio project page](images/portfolio-project-page.png)

The basic idea is to create a competitive research portfolio that showcases my previous research experience and makes me stand out to employers.  

* I plan to make the design interactive by having buttons that are clickable which allow the user to navigate to the individual project pages
* The accessibility piece of this design will come in the form of tab navigation, color contrast, and large, readable text
* I would like to convey to employers that I have professional work experience in the user experience research field and that I will be a dedicated, hardworking employee

### *Idea 2 - The Ramayana*
![Ramayana home page](images/ramayana.png)
![Ram](images/ram.jpg)
![Sita](images/sita.jpg)
![Lakshman](images/lakshman.jpg)
![Hanuman](images/hanuman.jpg)

The basic idea is to create an interactive learning experience for users to understand the history of Diwali by outlining the story of the Ramayana.  

* I plan to make the design interactive by allowing users to hover over each character card to learn more about them, create an interactive timeline which users can click on to be taken to a portion of the storyline.
* The accessibility piece of this design will come in the form of tab navigation, color contrast, and large, readable text.
* I would like to convey to users the importance of the story of the Ramayana. I want this platform to educate users about the origins and significance of Diwali, including how it is celebrated in the Hindu culture.  

### *Idea 3 - Angels on Stage*
![Angels on Stage home page](images/aos.png)

The basic idea is to create a website that will support and showcase, Angels on Stage, a performing arts program designed for children with disabilities.  

* I plan to make the design interactive by allowing users to visit each page on the website through the site navigation menu. They can click into each page which will have a variety of informational content (e.g., videos, photos, text, etc). 
* The accessibility piece of this design will come in the form of tab navigation, color contrast, and large, readable text.
* I would like to convey to users that disability is not something that limits individuals but rather something to celebrate. I would also like to use this platform to dispel common stereotypes.

## Feedback Summary

### *Idea 1 - Personal Portfolio*
I quickly shared this idea with a classmate during a speed dating critique session but opted not to get feedback since I decided early on to go in a different direction. My focus is shifting toward user experience research within the assistive technology space and I don’t feel that a JavaScript portfolio would best showcase my skills. Additionally, I would not be able to maintain it over time. Instead, I want to use a site like SquareSpace or Wix to visually demonstrate my abilities, with an emphasis on design over code.

### *Idea 2 - The Ramayana*
I got a range of feedback from my peers which was extremely helpful in determining which direction to go in. Brenna helped me consider a different visual style for the Ramayana website. Instead of an interactive timeline to show the story progression, she suggested I use parallax scrolling style to create a visual story. In this format, the story would be told vertically with various strong visual components. We also discussed making the website look and feel like a book with page flipping animations, a play on the idea that this is a Hindu epic which was historically depicted in a physical book. Seun suggested I compliment the parallax style by incorporating a progression bar so users don’t get frustrated with the continuous scrolling motion. She also added that I could include interactive anchor points on the progression bar so that users can skip ahead or backward. Finally, Niki mentioned that visuals will be hard to find for this project due to the fact that this story is an ancient religious text. She mentioned that I could use the p5 library to generate some artwork to complement the sparse visuals I could find. She said I could also supplement the visual component by animating my character cards. 

### *Idea 3 - Angels on Stage*
I also got great feedback on my Angels on Stage project proposal and this feedback ultimately led me to deciding on this idea. Lucy mentioned that thinking of the users before designing the interactive components was a great starting point and the right way to go about it. She did mention that an informal user test could be helpful to get an idea of users’ mental model of disability in order to effectively dispel their stereotypes about the topic. Evolone mentioned that I should consider which data I would like to pull in using an API. She suggested I think about data visualization through a pre-packaged library or software that would report on statistics around disability because this could emotionally hook users. Finally, Seun told me to strongly focus on the accessibility features of the website since this would be tailored to individuals with disabilities and their families. 

## Feedback Digestion
I made the decision to develop the Angels on Stage (AoS) website because I believe it aligns the most with my values and career aspirations. As I think about what the website design would look like, I believe it would serve me well to take components of feedback from both projects. Brenna’s feedback about using the parallax scrolling style to tell a visual story could be extremely powerful for the AoS website. It would help make the website visually engaging, creating an immersive experience that matches the dynamic storytelling aspect of this organization. Since visuals are key in this style, I reached out to my former volunteer coordinators for access to a collection of high-quality images that would enhance this parallax style and make the site feel cohesive. 

I also plan to incorporate Seun’s progression bar suggestion that would help users anchor to various points in the website. This would dispel frustration and create more of a story with the ability to jump forward and backwards. 

Finally, I plan to incorporate Lucy’s suggestion to perform an informal user test to understand the mental model of disability and learn about common stereotypes around disability. This would guide my language and interactive components to effectively convey the message. 

Once the design is completed, I plan to send it out to the AoS team so that they may consider using the design if it aligns with their vision. Of course, there will be no obligation to do so, but I would like to welcome their feedback throughout the process and would love it if my design could impact their community in a positive way.
