                    <h2>An Unspoken Love Story</h2>
                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>At the age of 15, a boy named Jet changed my life. He showed me my purpose: to advocate for those without a voice. Jet has Down Syndrome and he struggled to verbalize his love for others, but I never felt we needed words to communicate.</p>
                        <p>In the countless hours we spent together, Jet had never said my name; I wasn't sure he even knew who I was. But every game of catch we played, every book we read together, was a connection being built.</p>
                        <p>One day, he broke down his barriers and said, "Awiyah?" meaning Riya. Since that day, Jet remembers the name of every person he interacts with.</p>
